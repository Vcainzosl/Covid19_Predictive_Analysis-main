# Covid19_Predictive_Analysis
 Covid19 predictive analysis using machine learning algorithms.

## DataSet
The DataSet used to fit the machine learning models can be found here, [Datadista](https://github.com/datadista/datasets/blob/master/COVID%2019/provincias_covid19_datos_sanidad_nueva_serie.csv).

## Installation
In order to run the main program properly it is needed to take a look at the following libraries and be sure there are already installed.

You can use the pip command to install them easily through command window.

### Basics
This packages may be well known and should be installed in your python environment by default.
- NumPy
```bash
pip install numpy
```
- pandas
```bash
pip install pandas
```
### Also needed
The following libraries are also required:

- matplotlib
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
- seaborn
```bash
pip install seaborn
```
- scipy
```bash
pip install scipy
```

- scikit-learn

There are different ways to install ```scikit-learn```,  before moving to the installation, it requires the following:
- Python version 3.5 or higher
- NumPy version 1.11.0 or higher
- SciPy version 0.17.0 or higher
joblib 0.11 or higher.

And then:

```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
``` 
For more information check [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html).

- tensorflow
  
Now it is also necessary the ```TensorFlow``` library:
 
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

For more information check [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install?hl=es-419).

- keras

And finally, ```keras```:
```bash
pip install keras
```
For more information check [keras](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/keras/keras_installation.htm).

### Recommended
In order to take advantage of total functionalities of the program generation files:

- mdutils
```bash
pip install mdutils
```
More information here [mdutils](https://github.com/didix21/mdutils).

### Running
Having followed the previous installation steps, it is time to clone the [github repository](https://github.com/Vcainzosl/Covid19_Predictive_Analysis-main.git):
```bash
gitclone https://github.com/Vcainzosl/Covid19_Predictive_Analysis-main.git
```

After that, to run the program it is enough with:

```bash
python main.py
```
